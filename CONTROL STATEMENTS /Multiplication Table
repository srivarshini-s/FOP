Penny wanted to complete her graduation from the Community College of California. But being the newbee she is , she does not how to multiply two numbers. Sheldon being the good friend wanted to help Penny by writing C++ a program to print the multiplication table of an integer n.

Input Format:

Input consists of 2 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to n. 

The second integer corresponds to m(rows).

Output Format:

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input 1:

5

4

Sample Output 1:

Enter n

Enter m

The multiplication table of 5 is

1*5=5

2*5=10

3*5=15

4*5=20

Explanation:

Multiplication of the 5th table from 1 to 4 is printed.


Sample Input 2:

5

6

Sample Output 2:

Enter n

Enter m

The multiplication table of 5 is

1*5=5

2*5=10

3*5=15

4*5=20

5*5=25

6*5=30

Explanation:

Multiplication of the 5th table from 1 to 6 is printed.


CODE:

import java.util.*;
class Main
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
     System.out.println("Enter n");
    int n=s.nextInt();
    System.out.println("Enter m");
    int m=s.nextInt();
    System.out.println("The multiplication table of "+n+" is");
    for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
      System.out.println(i+"*"+n+"="+i*n);
  }
}
}
